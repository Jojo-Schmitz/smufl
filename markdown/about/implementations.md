Implementations
---------------

The reference font for SMuFL is Bravura, an OpenType font released under the
SIL Open Font License that can be downloaded from the [SMuFL web site](http://www.smufl.org/fonts). The example glyphs in this document are all taken
from Bravura.

Other SMuFL-compliant fonts are available under a variety of licenses. A list
of such fonts can be found [here](http://www.smufl.org/fonts).

Support for SMuFL-compliant fonts has been implemented by a variety of
applications. A list of applications that support SMuFL can be found [here](http://www.smufl.org/software).
